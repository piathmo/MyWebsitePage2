# My Love for Kansas City
Being from Kansas City can seem lame to some, but if you're from here then you know **there is SO much to do**. From the city life in South *Kansas City* to the suburban life in North Kansas City - you will always find something to do! One interesting fact is that Kansas City is actually being developed even more with major projects such as the new soccer stadium being built right under the main Christopher S. Bond bridge that connects the city to the suburbs or even the expansion of the street car into the northside of Kansas City. It is a very diverse city with people from all around, different restaurants, bars, entertainment, music, etc. My favorite things to do in Kansas CIty is go down to Westport over the weekend, ride *Birds* along main street, walk around the Riverfront, and just explore!
